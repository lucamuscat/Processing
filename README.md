Processing
--------------------
In this repository you may find some small side projects that I worked on using the '[Processing framework](https://processing.org/)' (mostly used to create [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art)).

# 1 ai Version
----
This is a small program in which a square moves from right to left, increasing its speed everytime it leaves the screen and comes back. Whilst all of this is happening, a rectangle tries to consistently jump over the square without hitting it. 

# 2 Drawing Board
----
A drawing board which is capable of changing canvas colour, brush colour, save the drawing as an image and also save the drawing process as a gif.

# 3 Moving Lines Background
----
Inspired by [Processing Network- B L Î› C K](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/111878)

# 4 Physics
----
Some basic physics simulations

# 5 Rain
----
Basic 8 bit-esque rain

# 6 Record and Play
----
A program which lets you move a rectangle, once you are satisfied with your moves you can replay your moves exactly as your inputted them!

# 7 Repulsion
----
A square which runes away for the cursor (One of my very first projects).

# 8 fft
----
An attractive audio visualiser.
